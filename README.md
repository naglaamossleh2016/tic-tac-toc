## Tic Tac Toe in JavaScript

This project implements a classic game of Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to choose the grid size (greater than 1) and provides a visual interface for playing the game.

### File Structure:

* **index.html:** Defines the structure of the Tic Tac Toe game board, including cells, player information displays, and a prompt for choosing the grid size.
* **style.css:** Provides visual styling for the game board elements, such as cell layout, font size, background colors, and player indicator styles.
* **script.js:** Contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling user interactions, creating the game board based on user input, implementing game logic (turn tracking, win conditions), and updating the board display.

### Running the Game:

1. **Download:** Clone or download the repository containing the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.
2. **Open:** Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Gameplay:

* Enter a number greater than 1 in the prompt to choose the desired grid size.
* Click on an empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
* The game will alternate turns between players.
* The game will automatically detect a win or a tie based on the game logic implemented in JavaScript.

### Functionality:

* User-defined grid size (greater than 1).
* Automatic board creation based on user input.
* Turn tracking for players (X and O).
* Win condition detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
* Tie detection (all cells filled without a winner).



### Additional Notes:

* Feel free to modify the code in the `script.js` file to customize the game logic and behavior.
