## Simple Calculator in JavaScript

This project implements a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides functionalities for performing arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and displaying the results on a user-friendly interface.

### File Structure:

* **index.html:** Defines the structure of the calculator webpage, including the input field, buttons, and container elements.
* **style.css:** Provides visual styling for the calculator's elements, such as button layout, font size, and background colors.
* **script.js:** Contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling user interactions with the calculator buttons, processing calculations, and updating the display with results.

### Running the Calculator:

1. **Download:** Clone or download the repository containing the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.
2. **Open:** Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Using the Calculator:

* Click on the number buttons (0-9) to enter numbers.
* Click on the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
* The results will be displayed in the input field.
* Use the "C" (Clear) button to erase the current input.

### Functionality:

* Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* Displays the current calculation in progress in the input field.
* Provides a clear button to reset the input.

### Customization:

This is a basic implementation. You can extend its capabilities by adding features such as:

* More mathematical functions (e.g., exponential, square root, trigonometric functions)
* Memory functions (store, recall, clear)
* Decimal point handling for more precise calculations
* Error handling (e.g., division by zero)
* User interface enhancements (e.g., button grid layout, color themes)

### Additional Notes:

* Feel free to modify the code in the `script.js` file to customize the calculator's behavior.
